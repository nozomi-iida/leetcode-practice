#Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating 
#characters. 
#
# 
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input: s = "abcabcbb"
#Output: 3
#Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
# 
#
# Example 2: 
#
# 
#Input: s = "bbbbb"
#Output: 1
#Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# 
#
# Example 3: 
#
# 
#Input: s = "pwwkew"
#Output: 3
#Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
#Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a 
#substring.
# 
#
# 
# Constraints: 
#
# 
# 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10⁴ 
# s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
